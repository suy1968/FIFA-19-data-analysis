# FIFA'19 DATA ANALYSIS

This is an Udacity Nanodegree project. I chose FIFA 19 complete player dataset. 

My key interests would be:

1. What's the ratio of  total wages/ total potential for clubs. Which clubs are the most economical ï¼Ÿ
2. How is nation team player total market value distributed? Probably show a distribution plot in a world map?
3. How is a player's skilsl set influence his potential/wage? Can we predict a player's potential based on his skills' set?
